Project 1 - Emulating TCP using UDP
Eurolfan, Jan Ellis D.

CMSC 137 CD-2L 1S 15-16

How to run:
    -> Run Server and Client classes independently
    -> Output is printed on the terminal

Note:
    -> I have submitted a similar output last year via Cloud9. It was written by me and another groupmate (Abano, Naomi). This is a bit different from what was submitted there.
